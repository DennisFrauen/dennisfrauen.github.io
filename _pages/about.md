I am a final year PhD student at the [Institute of AI in Management](https://www.som.lmu.de/ai/en/), [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), supervised by Prof. Stefan Feuerriegel. I am also an [Ellis](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD student, co-supervised by [Prof. Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com/) (University of Cambridge) My research focuses mainly on causal inference and machine learning. In particular, I develop efficient, robust, and reliable machine learning methods for causal inference. Furthermore, I use ideas from causality to make data-driven decision-making optimal and fair.

### Research interests
- Causal machine learning
- Uncertainty quantification
- Partial identification and sensitivity analysis
- Off-policy learning
- (Causal) algorithmic fairness
